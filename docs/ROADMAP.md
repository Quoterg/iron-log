# Roadmap

Goal: a Cronometer-class, open-source nutrition tracker that is Swedish-first, works
everywhere, and stays fast on old low/mid-range phones (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)).

One milestone ≈ one weekly session (~5M tokens). If a milestone turns out larger, split it
(`M7a`, `M7b`) here and do the first part. Mark done with `[x]` and the PR number.
Status of the current work lives in [PROGRESS.md](../PROGRESS.md).

## Phase 1 — Usable daily tracker (Sweden)

- [x] **M1 Foundation** — Preact PWA, Livsmedelsverket data pipeline, worker search
  (diacritics + Swedish compounds), diary with meals, NNR 2023 targets, nutrients view,
  settings (sv/en, sex, kcal), offline service worker, size budget, unit + Playwright tests.
- [x] **M2 CI & deploy** — GitHub Actions: unit tests, build + size budget, Playwright smoke
  (Moto G4 + 4× CPU throttle) on PRs; deploy `main` to GitHub Pages; README badge + live link.
  Lighthouse CI gate (mobile, simulated slow 4G): performance ≥ 90, FCP ≤ 1.8 s, LCP ≤ 2.5 s,
  TBT ≤ 200 ms, CLS ≤ 0.1. (TTI no longer exists in Lighthouse; LCP + TBT replace it.)
- [x] **M3 Food detail & custom foods** — Food detail screen (all nutrients per 100 g and per
  chosen amount, source + license). Create/edit/delete custom foods (stored in IndexedDB,
  searchable alongside built-in foods, `custom:<uuid>` refs). Edit an entry's food/meal/date.
- [x] **M4 Fast re-logging** — Recent & frequent foods shown before typing; favourites; copy a
  meal or a whole day to another date; search ranking boosted by the user's own history.
  Rank everyday items first ("ris" → cooked rice before raw).
- [x] **M5 Your data** — Export/import everything (JSON backup + CSV of diary/nutrients),
  "storage is persistent" status, delete-all. Prompt to install to home screen (iOS hint).
- [x] **M6 Serving sizes** — Household units per food (st, dl, msk, tsk, portion, skiva) from a
  curated table for common SLV foods + user-defined servings; amount picker supports units.
- [x] **M7 Barcode scanning** — Open Food Facts lookup by barcode (typed or scanned), mapped to
  the nutrient vector, cached locally. Camera scanning via `BarcodeDetector` where available,
  lazily loaded WASM fallback (zxing-wasm) only when the scanner opens. Attribution (ODbL).

## Phase 2 — Cronometer depth

- [x] **M8 Profile-based targets** — Age, weight, height, body fat %, activity → energy need
  as on tdeecalculator.net (Katch–McArdle with body fat %, else Mifflin–St Jeor; activity
  1.2–1.9 — owner's choice, M8.1); NNR 2023 age bands (18–24, 25–50, 51–70, 71+),
  pregnancy/lactation, post-menopause iron. Unit tests against NNR tables.
- [x] **M9 Target editor** — Per-nutrient min/max overrides, macro targets in g or E%,
  presets (NNR default, high-protein, low-carb, keto), reset to defaults.
- [x] **M10 Recipes** — Recipes from ingredients, servings, cooked yield/weight change;
  log by serving or grams; recipe nutrient summary.
- [x] **M11 Global food data** — USDA FoodData Central (Foundation + SR Legacy, public domain)
  mapped to the same nutrient keys; data split per source and loaded by language/region
  setting; keep each file within budget; source badges in results.
- [ ] **M12 Body log & charts** — Weight, body fat, waist; tiny hand-written SVG charts
  (no chart library); trend line (moving average).
- [ ] **M13 Reports & insights** — Day/week/month averages per nutrient, "top contributors"
  for any nutrient, nutrient-gap highlights vs. targets, simple streaks.
- [ ] **M14 Activity** — Exercise log (MET table, kcal burned), optional adding of burned
  energy to the day's target; water intake.
- [ ] **M15 Supplements** — Supplements with per-unit nutrients, daily schedules, quick log.
- [ ] **M16 More nutrients** — Add the remaining SLV/USDA nutrients (vitamin K, B5, biotin,
  copper, manganese, amino acids where available) with NNR targets; nutrient detail pages.

## Phase 3 — Everywhere

- [ ] **M17 Sync (optional, self-hostable)** — End-to-end encrypted sync: tiny server
  (Node + SQLite, Docker image), client key never leaves devices; app stays fully usable without.
- [ ] **M18 Languages & accessibility** — Extract strings to JSON, add nb/da/fi/de; full
  a11y audit (screen readers, contrast, font scaling 200%); RTL-safe CSS.
- [ ] **M19 App stores** — Android Trusted Web Activity build (Bubblewrap), F-Droid notes,
  store listing texts, privacy policy, landing page.
- [ ] **M20 Contribute back** — Submit missing products/photos to Open Food Facts from the app;
  report data errors; contributor docs.
